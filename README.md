## About the Project

Created for a graduate school project, this was a re-hash of a demo application that I created originially in PHP.  The reason it is now in JS, is because I didn't make any security within the application and was getting spammed.  The application was out for demo purposes and wasn't something I could show a potential employer as it sat.  I removed PHP and created all the functionality using JS.  

Normally these features would all require login, but for the demonstration and showcasing the project everything is going to be resolved in the localhost and using your browsers free localStorage. Also this helps me avoid spammers and people trying to hack into an application that is simply a demonstration of skill.

##DEPENDENCIES FOR THE PROJECT:

###Angular
AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. I'm going to use angular because it does a nice job with data binding. This databinding will help us in the end result of our product.

###Karma
Spectacular Test Runner for JavaScript.

### Grunt - Yeoman - Bower
For handling the dirty work and optimizing the project as much as possible and keeping track of the npm and other dependencies.

### Bootstrap
Using bootstrap just gives the added benefit of a grid and some pre-styled elements so that I can focus on functionality more than having to reset and redesign each item that is created on the page. There will still be some stying issues, but the main focus is that the applciation works.
