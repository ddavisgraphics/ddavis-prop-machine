  <h2>About the Project </h2>
  <p>
    For this project we are using many wonderful frameworks that are going to help us leverage the most out of the this little application and develope 
    features quickly and rapidly.  Following the best conventions possible.  Normally these features would all require login, but for the demonstration 
    and showcasing the project everything is going to be resolved in the localhost and using your browsers free storage localStorage.  Also this helps
    me avoid spammers and people trying to hack into an application that is a demonstration of skill.        
  </p>
    
 <p> 
    Cool notes about this project is that it will be done completely with Javascript, because I have a very big problem with PHP.  I could use Ruby, but I like javascript better.  If I were deploying this into a real live web app, with multiple users I might consider adjusting the frameworks then.  Again this is a prototype.

 <h3> Dependencies for the Project: </h3>

  <h4>Angular</h4>
  <p>
    AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. I'm going to use angular because it does a nice job with data binding.  This databinding will help us in the end result of our product.  
  </p>

  <h4>Karma</h4>
  <p>Spectacular Test Runner for JavaScript.</p>
    
  <h4> Grunt - Yeoman - Bower </h4>
  <p> For handling the dirty work and optimizing the project as much as possible and keeping track of the npm and other dependencies. </p>
    
    
  <h4> Bootstrap </h4>
  <p> Using bootstrap just gives the added benefit of a grid and some pre-styled elements so that I can focus on functionality more than having to reset and redesign each item that is created on the page.  There will still be some stying issues, but the main focus is that the applciation works. </p>
